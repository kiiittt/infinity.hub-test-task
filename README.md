#untitle project

This project was written for a test task in Infinity.Hub

It has a responsive design for desktop and mobile versions.
It also has a form with a countdown timer and a modal window that appears when the user has been on the site for 20 seconds, as well as when the cursor moves outside the site boundaries. When you click on the button in the modal window, you scroll to the form.
